# qiskit-certified-exam-notes
Hi everyone! I am Ritu, a fellow Qiskitter. I have recently taken the Quantum Developer Certification exam and have followed the excellent study guide by James Weaver (https://slides.com/javafxpert/prep-qiskit-dev-cert-exam), which also goes over the sample exam, and a workbook by Bartu Bisign (https://github.com/bartubisgin/qiskit-certified-exam-workbook), so make sure to check these out if you haven't already!

While studying for the exam, I went over the qiskit functions as well as the theoretical concepts behind them, for better understanding.
